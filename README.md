#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles, methods and tools for the development of software systems with high quality and the maintenance of it. It creates software applications and systems that aid communication,commercial activities, entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. In 1968, the first NATO software engineering conference was held.
2. In the 1970s, A number of new methodologies were developed including structured programming and object-oriented programming.
3. In the 1980s, the first Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools were developed.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. PLANNING REQUIREMENTS PHASE: This is the first phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC) and it entails the basic requirements for the software which will be discussed between the client and development team. These basic requirements include the purpose of the application, the details about the end user of the product, key elements like format and attributes of the application for designing and the overall user interfaces design of the software.
2. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS PHASE: This includes a detailed information about each element to design the software as discussed in the planning stage, validating the installation of the elements in the application according to the client's requirement, calibrating the security protocols and performing risk analysis for the software application and finally filing all discussed details in the Software Requirements Specification Document also known as the SRS.
3. DESIGN PHASE: This phase includes devising the system design following the SRS document and it will be done by the software designers. This system design defines the overall architecture and checks it's feasibility with the client's requirement. All details of the design are added to the Design Document Specifications (DDS) and shared with the analysts and stakeholders for review.
4. CODING/IMPLEMENTATION PHASE: The developer starts writing the code using the language they choose for the software development. It is also one of the most important phases as it encapsulates the implementation of the software product. The developers use predefined guidelines and development like compilers and debuggers to implement the code.
5. TESTING PHASE: The developed software is deployed in multiple test environment to check the functioning of all the attributes in the software architecture. After the testing is completed, the Quality Assurance and the testing team may find errors or bugs in the software which will be forwarded to the developer team for debugging. The testing and debugging process is continued until the software system is stable.
6. DEPLOYMENT AND MAINTENANCE: When the testing phase is completed, the software is ready for deployment and customer use. In this phase, the development team will set up the installation link for the users. After deployment is completed and users begin to use the application,they might encounter an error or a big which is to be solved from time to time, hence, debugging of the application is done on regular basis. It also includes releasing application updates and enhancement features for the software for better performance and user experience.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile methodology is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation while Waterfall methodology is sequential and rigid with distinct phases completed in order.
Agile promotes ongoing collaboration while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages.
The Agile methodology was created for projects where the significant constraints are not well understood while the Waterfall methodology is best for projects with concrete timelines and well-defined deliverables. If your major project constraints are well understood and documented, Waterfall is likely the best approach.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: They design, program, build, deploy, and maintain software using many different skills and tools. They also help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure that those systems remain functional.
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: They design  test plans, scenarios, script or procedures. They also document software defects using a bug tracking system and report defects to software developers. They identify, analyse and document problems with program function, output, online screen or content.
PROJECT MANAGER: is responsible for planning, scheduling and managing the delivery of software and web projects. They're usually qualified in computer science, software engineering or a similar subject and have strong technical knowledge of IT, development and computer systems.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing and packaging in an easy-to-use application.e.g. Eclipse.
A VCS automates the process of version control. It tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you do not have to manage file versions manually or with custom automation scripts e.g. Got.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Lack of workflow visibility and it can be overcome by investing in project management tools, engineering analytics tools, observability and monitoring tools.
2. Broken SDLC processes and it can be solved by inspecting, detecting and fixing the root cause.
3. Lack of predictability in software delivery and it can be improved by minimising external dependability, especially avoiding getting locked in the cloud.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING: The smallest testable part of the software system is often referred to as a unit: a new code,a refractoring of legacy code. It is important to ensure code is developed correctly. Therefore,the testing system is aimed at examining every single unit of a software system in order to make sure that it meets the original requirements and functions as expected.
INTEGRATION TESTING: The objective of this testing level is to verify whether the combined units work well together as a group. it is aimed at detecting flaws in the interactions between the units within a module.
SYSTEM TESTING: At this level, a complete software system is tested as a whole. It includes user flows, performance and security. This stage serves to verify the products compliance with the functional and technical Requirements and overall quality standards.
USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING: This is where the product is validated against the end user Requirements. It is the last stage of the testing process that ensure customers' expectations are met, verifying acceptance tests on the stories and the features. This final step helps the team to decide if the products are to be shipped or not.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a method of crafting clear and specific questions or instructions that will provide the best response from an AI assistant or robot. Therefore, it saves you the stress of scribbling through details and gives you the exact response that you need in a simple format.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE PROMPT: Tell me about Nigerian movies
CLEAR PROMPT: Narrate the story of the Nigerian movie titled "TWIN SISTERS"
The first prompt would generalise the concept of Nigerian movies while the second one would give a detailed storyline of what happened in the mentioned movie.
